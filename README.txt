Something to note is that our solution does not match the reference solutions output for certain scenes involving refractions. 
One in particular being sphere_refract.ray.

Most of our logic comes from the materials learned in lecture and that was available to us on the slides. 
We used box filtering as our anti aliasing technique and utilized the Möller–Trumbore ray-triangle intersection 
algorithm for computations involving triangle meshes.
